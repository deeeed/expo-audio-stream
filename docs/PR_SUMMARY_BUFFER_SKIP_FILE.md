# PR Summary: Buffer Duration & Skip File Writing Features

## Overview

This PR adds two new recording configuration options to expo-audio-studio:

1. **`bufferDurationSeconds`**: Allows customization of audio buffer duration
2. **`skipFileWriting`**: Enables audio streaming without file persistence

## Changes Made

### TypeScript API
- Added `bufferDurationSeconds?: number` to `RecordingConfig` interface
- Added `skipFileWriting?: boolean` to `RecordingConfig` interface
- Full JSDoc documentation included

### iOS Implementation
- Modified `AudioStreamManager.swift` to support dynamic buffer sizing
- Added conditional file creation/writing logic for skip mode
- Implemented buffer accumulation for iOS minimum buffer size limitation

### Integration Tests ✅
- Created comprehensive integration tests that validate ACTUAL platform behavior
- Tests discovered iOS enforces minimum buffer of ~4800 frames (0.1s at 48kHz)
- All 13 tests passing (8 buffer tests, 5 skip file tests)

### Documentation
- Updated existing `standalone-recording.md` with examples
- Updated `recording-config.md` API reference with detailed sections
- Did NOT create separate feature files (following best practices)

## Key Discoveries

### iOS Platform Limitation
Integration testing revealed iOS AVAudioEngine enforces an undocumented minimum buffer size:
- Requests below 4800 frames are ignored
- At 48kHz, this equals 0.1 seconds minimum
- Library now handles this transparently with buffer accumulation

## Test Results

```bash
# Buffer Duration Tests
Summary: 8/8 tests passed
- iOS minimum: 4800 frames
- Maximum observed: 19200 frames
- Accumulation works for small buffers

# Skip File Writing Tests  
Summary: 5/5 tests passed
- No file creation when enabled
- Data emission continues
- Pause/Resume works correctly
```

## Usage Examples

### Low-latency streaming
```typescript
await startRecording({
  bufferDurationSeconds: 0.02, // 20ms
  skipFileWriting: true,
  onAudioStream: (data) => {
    // Real-time processing
  }
});
```

### Efficient recording
```typescript
await startRecording({
  bufferDurationSeconds: 0.2, // 200ms
  compression: { enabled: true }
});
```

## Platform Support

- ✅ iOS: Complete with workarounds for platform limitations
- ⏳ Android: To be implemented in follow-up PR
- ⏳ Web: To be implemented in follow-up PR

## Breaking Changes

None. These features are fully backward compatible.

## Performance Impact

- Buffer Duration: Larger buffers reduce CPU usage but increase latency
- Skip File Writing: Eliminates I/O overhead, reduces battery usage
