## Setup for Development

### Git LFS for ONNX Models

This project uses ONNX models that are stored using Git LFS. Before you begin development:

1. Install Git LFS: https://git-lfs.github.com/
2. Run our setup script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup-lfs.sh
   ```

For detailed information about model management, please see [docs/MODEL_MANAGEMENT.md](docs/MODEL_MANAGEMENT.md).
