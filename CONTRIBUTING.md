## Quick Start

### Setup
```bash
# 1. Install Git LFS for ONNX models
./scripts/setup-lfs.sh

# 2. Install dependencies  
yarn install

# 3. Build packages
cd apps/playground && yarn build:deps
```

### Development Approaches

**ðŸ¤– Agentic Framework (Recommended)**
```bash
cd apps/playground
yarn agent:setup              # Setup devices (first time)
yarn agent:dev <feature>      # Validate feature works (< 2 minutes)
```

**ðŸ§ª Traditional Testing**
```bash
./scripts/run_tests.sh        # Run comprehensive test suite
```

### Constraints
- NEVER IMPLEMENT UNLESS ASKED
- ALWAYS VERIFY IN SOURCE CODE  
- MINIMIZE DIFF
- NO WORKAROUNDS - fix root causes
- REAL TESTING ONLY
