- use interface over types when possible
- Avoid enums, use const objects instead
- Prefer object parameters to function.
- Use strict type checking.
- Never use any, prefer types object or use unknown 
- Do not create useless index.ts files that are only there to re-export interface, you must directly import the target interface where it needs to be used.
