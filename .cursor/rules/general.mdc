# General Engineering Principles

You are a senior software engineer specializing in building scalable and maintainable systems using TypeScript.

## Architecture Principles

When designing and implementing features, apply these architectural principles:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Split functionality into dedicated classes/modules with clear boundaries
2. **Single Responsibility**: Each class/function should do one thing well
3. **Minimum Modification**: Make minimal changes to existing files when adding features
4. **Consistent API**: Maintain consistent API patterns across platforms and modules
5. **Error Handling**: Provide clear error messages with recovery options when possible
6. **Platform Abstraction**: Abstract platform-specific implementations behind common interfaces

## Development Process

- For any change affecting multiple files, altering APIs, or modifying system architecture, always start with a plan of action and seek approval before proceeding.
- For simple changes, make the code change directly but always think carefully and step-by-step.
- When a file becomes too long, split it into smaller files.
- When a function becomes too long, split it into smaller functions.

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)

**RECOMMENDED**: New features should follow Test-Driven Development practices when possible. The testing framework is now available to support this approach.

### MANDATORY: Integration Tests for New Features

**Every new feature MUST include integration tests that validate ACTUAL platform behavior.** Integration tests are not optional - they are required because they:

- Reveal undocumented platform limitations (e.g., iOS minimum buffer sizes)
- Validate actual behavior, not mocked behavior
- Ensure cross-platform consistency
- Serve as living documentation of platform quirks

Example discovery from integration testing:
```swift
// Integration test revealed iOS AVAudioEngine enforces minimum 4800 frames
// This critical limitation would have been missed by unit tests
// The library now handles this transparently with buffer accumulation
```

See `docs/PR_METHODOLOGY.md` for detailed requirements.

### TDD Workflow for New Features

1. **Architecture First**
   - Define the feature's API and interfaces before implementation
   - Create a design document outlining the approach
   - Consider cross-platform consistency from the start

2. **Write Tests Before Code (When Feasible)**
   - Create comprehensive test cases that define expected behavior
   - Include unit tests, integration tests, and platform-specific tests
   - Tests should fail initially (Red phase)

3. **Implementation Order**
   - TypeScript interfaces/types first
   - iOS implementation + tests passing
   - Android implementation + tests passing
   - Web implementation (if applicable) + tests passing
   - Cross-platform integration tests
   - **Update playground app to demonstrate the feature**

4. **Test Categories**
   - **Unit Tests**: Pure logic, no platform dependencies
   - **Platform Tests**: iOS/Android specific implementations
   - **Integration Tests**: End-to-end feature validation
   - **Consistency Tests**: Ensure identical behavior across platforms

### Example TDD Flow

```typescript
// 1. FIRST: Define the interface
interface AudioFeature {
  process(data: Float32Array): FeatureResult;
}

// 2. SECOND: Write failing tests
describe('AudioFeature', () => {
  it('should process audio data correctly', () => {
    const feature = new AudioFeature();
    const result = feature.process(testData);
    expect(result.value).toBe(expectedValue);
  });
});

// 3. THIRD: Implement for each platform
// - iOS: Swift implementation
// - Android: Kotlin implementation
// - Web: TypeScript implementation

// 4. FOURTH: Validate cross-platform consistency
it('should produce identical results on all platforms', () => {
  expect(iosResult).toEqual(androidResult);
  expect(androidResult).toEqual(webResult);
});
```

### Test Requirements

- Target 80% code coverage for new features
- Aim for 100% coverage for critical paths and public APIs
- All edge cases and error scenarios should be tested
- Performance benchmarks for computationally intensive features

> **Note**: The testing framework is newly established. While comprehensive testing is highly recommended, contributors should balance test coverage with practical development needs.

## Debugging Approach

### Problem-Solving Methodology

When debugging a problem:
- Ensure you have sufficient information to deeply understand the problem
- Add logging and tracing before making changes
- If logs clearly indicate the problem, implement a targeted solution
- If unsure, reflect on 4-6 possible causes, identify the 1-2 most likely, and proceed accordingly
- **Always add tests to prevent regression of fixed bugs when possible**

### Logging Best Practices

1. **Structured Logging**
   - Use consistent log prefixes/tags for filtering
   - Include component/module names in logs
   - Use appropriate log levels (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG)

2. **Platform-Specific Debugging**
   - **Android**: Use ADB logcat with grep filters
   - **iOS**: Use Console app or log stream commands
   - **Web**: Use browser developer tools

3. **Debugging Guidelines**
   - Add temporary debug logs when investigating issues
   - Remove or convert to appropriate log level before committing
   - Include relevant context in error messages
   - Log function entry/exit for complex flows when debugging

4. **Performance Debugging**
   - Measure and log execution times for critical operations
   - Use platform-specific profiling tools
   - Monitor memory usage and potential leaks

### Example Logging Pattern

```typescript
// Good: Structured, filterable, informative
console.log('[ModuleName:FunctionName] Processing started', { userId, timestamp });
console.error('[ModuleName:FunctionName] Failed to process', { error, context });

// Bad: Unstructured, hard to filter
console.log('error happened');
```

## Documentation Practices

### Update Existing Documentation

When adding new features or configuration options:

1. **DO NOT create new documentation files** for simple additions
2. **Update existing documentation** in the appropriate sections
3. **Add examples** to relevant usage guides
4. **Document platform-specific behavior** discovered through testing

Example:
```typescript
// ❌ BAD: Creating new file for two config options
docs/features/buffer-duration-skip-file.md

// ✅ GOOD: Update existing files
documentation_site/docs/usage/standalone-recording.md (add examples)
documentation_site/docs/api-reference/recording-config.md (add API details)
```

### Documentation Structure

- Keep documentation close to the code
- Use JSDoc for inline API documentation
- Update user-facing docs in `documentation_site/`
- Keep technical/implementation docs in package-specific `docs/`
