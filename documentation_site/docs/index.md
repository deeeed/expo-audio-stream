# @siteed/expo-audio-studio

`@siteed/expo-audio-studio` is a comprehensive library designed to facilitate real-time audio processing and streaming across iOS, Android, and web platforms.

## Overview

**@siteed/expo-audio-studio** provides a complete audio solution for React Native and Expo applications with recording, analysis, visualization, and streaming capabilities. The library offers a unified API that works consistently across iOS, Android, and web platforms.

> **Important Requirement:** This library requires using an ejected Expo project (bare workflow). You must run `npx expo prebuild` to eject from the managed workflow before using this library. See the [Installation](installation.md) section for details.

> **Note:** This package was formerly known as `@siteed/expo-audio-stream`. The name has been changed to better reflect the expanded capabilities beyond just audio streaming.
