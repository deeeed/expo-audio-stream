- On Android and iOS, audio is recorded in WAV format, 16kHz sample rate, 16-bit depth, 1 channel.
- On the web, it usually records in Opus but it depends on the browser configuration.

If you want to process the audio livestream directly, I recommend having another encoding step to align the audio format across platforms.
