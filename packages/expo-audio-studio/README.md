## Audio Analysis Features

Extract powerful audio features for advanced audio processing and visualization:

```typescript
// Extract audio analysis with specific features enabled
const analysis = await extractAudioAnalysis({
  fileUri: 'path/to/recording.wav',
  features: {
    energy: true,     // Overall energy of the audio
    rms: true,        // Root mean square (amplitude)
    zcr: true,        // Zero-crossing rate
    mfcc: true,       // Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients
    spectralCentroid: true,  // Brightness of sound
    tempo: true,      // Estimated BPM
  }
});
```

### Available Audio Features

- **Basic Analysis**: RMS, energy, amplitude range, zero-crossing rate
- **Spectral Features**: Spectral centroid, flatness, rolloff, bandwidth
- **Advanced Analysis**: 
  - MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients)
  - Chromagram (pitch class representation)
  - Mel Spectrogram
  - Harmonics-to-noise ratio
  - Tempo estimation
  - Pitch detection

### Use Cases

- Visualize audio waveforms with detailed metrics
- Implement speech recognition preprocessing
- Create music analysis applications
- Build audio fingerprinting systems
- Develop voice activity detection

## API Overview

The library provides several specialized APIs for different audio processing needs:

### Recording and Playback

- **useAudioRecorder**: Hook for recording audio with configurable quality settings
- **AudioRecorderProvider**: Context provider for sharing recording state across components
- **useSharedAudioRecorder**: Hook to access shared recording state from any component

```typescript
// Start a new recording with configuration
const { startRecording, stopRecording, isRecording, recordingUri } = useAudioRecorder({
  audioQuality: 'high',
  sampleRate: 44100,
  numberOfChannels: 2,
  bitDepth: 16,
  outputFormat: 'wav',
});

// Use the prepare API for zero-latency recording
const { prepareRecording, startRecording, stopRecording } = useSharedAudioRecorder();

// First prepare the recording - this initializes all resources
await prepareRecording({
  sampleRate: 44100,
  channels: 2,
  encoding: 'pcm_16bit'
});

// Later when needed, start instantly with no delay
await startRecording(/* same config as prepare */);

// Share recording state across components
const AudioApp = () => (
  <AudioRecorderProvider>
    <RecordButton />
    <AudioVisualizer />
  </AudioRecorderProvider>
);
```

### Audio Analysis

- **extractAudioAnalysis**: Extract comprehensive audio features for detailed analysis
- **extractPreview**: Generate lightweight waveform data for visualization
- **extractAudioData**: Extract raw PCM data for custom processing
- **extractRawWavAnalysis**: Analyze WAV files without decoding, preserving original PCM values

```typescript
// Extract detailed audio analysis with feature extraction
const analysis = await extractAudioAnalysis({
  fileUri: 'path/to/recording.wav',
  features: { rms: true, zcr: true, mfcc: true }
});

// Generate a lightweight waveform preview
const preview = await extractPreview({
  fileUri: 'path/to/recording.wav',
  pointsPerSecond: 50
});

// Extract raw PCM data for custom processing
const audioData = await extractAudioData({
  fileUri: 'path/to/recording.wav',
  includeWavHeader: true
});
```

#### Choosing the Right Audio Analysis Method

| Method | Purpose | Performance | Use When |
|--------|---------|-------------|----------|
| `extractAudioAnalysis` | Comprehensive audio feature extraction | Medium-Heavy | You need detailed audio features like MFCC, spectral features |
| `extractPreview` | Lightweight waveform visualization | Very Light | You only need amplitude data for visualization |
| `extractAudioData` | Raw PCM data extraction | Medium | You need the raw audio data for custom processing |
| `extractRawWavAnalysis` | WAV analysis without decoding | Light | You want to analyze WAV files while preserving original values |
| `extractMelSpectrogram` | Mel spectrogram generation | Heavy | You need frequency-domain representation for ML or visualization |

### Specialized Audio Processing

- **extractMelSpectrogram**: Generate mel spectrogram for audio visualization or ML models
- **trimAudio**: Trim audio files with precision, supporting multiple segments and formats

```typescript
// Generate mel spectrogram for audio visualization or ML models
const melSpectrogram = await extractMelSpectrogram({
  fileUri: 'path/to/recording.wav',
  windowSizeMs: 25,
  hopLengthMs: 10,
  nMels: 40
});

// Trim audio files with precision
const trimmedAudio = await trimAudio({
  fileUri: 'path/to/recording.wav',
  startTimeMs: 1000,
  endTimeMs: 5000,
  outputFormat: { format: 'wav' }
});

// Trim multiple segments from an audio file
const compiledAudio = await trimAudio({
  fileUri: 'path/to/recording.wav',
  mode: 'keep',
  ranges: [
    { startTimeMs: 1000, endTimeMs: 5000 },
    { startTimeMs: 10000, endTimeMs: 15000 }
  ]
});
```

### Utility Functions

- **convertPCMToFloat32**: Convert PCM data to Float32Array for processing
- **getWavFileInfo**: Extract metadata from WAV files
- **writeWavHeader**: Create WAV headers for raw PCM data

### Low-Level Access

For advanced use cases, the library provides direct access to the native module:

```typescript
import { ExpoAudioStreamModule } from '@siteed/expo-audio-studio';

// Access platform-specific functionality
const status = await ExpoAudioStreamModule.status();
const permissions = await ExpoAudioStreamModule.getPermissionsAsync();
```
