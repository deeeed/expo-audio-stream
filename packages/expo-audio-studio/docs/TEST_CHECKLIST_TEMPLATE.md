# Test Checklist Template: [Feature Name]

**Feature**: [Brief description of the feature]
**Developer**: [Your name]
**Date**: [Start date]

> **Note**: This checklist represents best practices for feature development. While comprehensive testing is highly recommended, adapt this template to your specific needs and the current state of the codebase.

## Pre-Implementation Phase

### 1. Architecture Design
- [ ] Feature requirements documented
- [ ] API design completed
- [ ] Cross-platform considerations documented
- [ ] Performance requirements defined
- [ ] Error handling strategy defined

### 2. Test Specification (Recommended)
- [ ] Test plan created
- [ ] Unit test cases defined
- [ ] Integration test cases defined
- [ ] Platform-specific test cases defined
- [ ] Performance benchmarks defined

## Implementation Phase

### 3. Test-First Development (Red Phase - When Feasible)

#### Unit Tests
```typescript
// src/__tests__/[feature].test.ts
- [ ] Basic functionality tests
- [ ] Configuration options tests
- [ ] Edge case tests
- [ ] Error scenario tests
- [ ] Input validation tests
```

#### Platform Tests
```kotlin
// android/src/test/java/.../[Feature]Test.kt
- [ ] Android unit tests written
- [ ] Android instrumented tests written (if needed)
```

```swift
// ios/[Feature]Tests.swift
- [ ] iOS unit tests written
- [ ] iOS integration tests written
```

### 4. Implementation (Green Phase)

#### TypeScript/JavaScript
- [ ] Types/interfaces defined
- [ ] Core logic implemented
- [ ] Error handling implemented
- [ ] JSDoc documentation added

#### iOS Implementation
- [ ] Swift implementation complete
- [ ] iOS-specific error handling
- [ ] Memory management verified
- [ ] Thread safety verified

#### Android Implementation
- [ ] Kotlin implementation complete
- [ ] Android-specific error handling
- [ ] Memory management verified
- [ ] Thread safety verified

#### Web Implementation (if applicable)
- [ ] Web implementation complete
- [ ] Browser compatibility verified
- [ ] Web Worker support (if needed)

### 5. Cross-Platform Validation

#### Consistency Tests
- [ ] iOS vs Android output comparison
- [ ] Web vs Native comparison (if applicable)
- [ ] Performance comparison across platforms
- [ ] Error handling consistency

#### Integration Tests
- [ ] Works with existing features
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained
- [ ] No regression in existing tests

## Post-Implementation Phase

### 6. Code Quality

#### Refactoring (Refactor Phase)
- [ ] Code duplication removed
- [ ] Complex functions simplified
- [ ] Performance optimizations applied
- [ ] Code review feedback addressed

#### Documentation
- [ ] API documentation complete
- [ ] Usage examples provided
- [ ] Migration guide (if breaking changes)
- [ ] Performance characteristics documented

### 7. Test Coverage

#### Coverage Metrics (Target Goals)
- [ ] Unit test coverage ≥ 80%
- [ ] Critical path coverage = 100%
- [ ] Error handling coverage = 100%
- [ ] Platform-specific code coverage ≥ 80%

#### Test Quality
- [ ] Tests are deterministic
- [ ] Tests are independent
- [ ] Tests are fast (< 100ms each)
- [ ] Tests use real test data

### 8. Performance Validation

#### Benchmarks
- [ ] Processing time measured
- [ ] Memory usage measured
- [ ] CPU usage measured
- [ ] Battery impact assessed (mobile)

#### Performance Targets
- [ ] Meets latency requirements
- [ ] Meets throughput requirements
- [ ] No memory leaks
- [ ] Efficient resource usage
