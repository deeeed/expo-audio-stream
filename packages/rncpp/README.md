# rncpp

poc rn cpp

The goal is to see how to include cpp code in either expo library or project.
The issue is that it is difficult (haven't figured it out yet) to add cpp code with expo libraries which differ from actual rn libraries.
Easier solution is to decouple and have a specific library only for cpp.
