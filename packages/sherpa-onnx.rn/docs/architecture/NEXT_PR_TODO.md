# Next PR: React Native Architecture & Real ONNX Validation

## Overview

This document outlines the tasks for the next development phase to complete comprehensive sherpa-onnx.rn validation.

## Phase 2 Goals

1. **React Native Architecture Compatibility** - Validate across Old/New Architecture
2. **Real ONNX Functionality** - Test actual model loading and inference
3. **Performance & Memory Validation** - Production-ready stability testing
4. **iOS Integration Completion** - Full iOS testing parity with Android

## Detailed TODO Items

  - Detect Old Architecture (Bridge-based) vs New Architecture (JSI)
  - Test JSI availability and functionality
  - Validate module registration differences

- [ ] **Create architecture-specific test suites**
  ```kotlin
  @Test
  fun testOldArchitectureBridge() {
      // Test Promise-based async calls

  }

  @Test 
  fun testNewArchitectureJSI() {
      // Test direct JSI synchronous calls
      // Validate TurboModule registration
      // Test JSI memory management
  }
  ```
